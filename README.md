# Project Description

This Project is a simple TO-DO LIST that has been created using JavaScript DOM

The interfcae is quite simple which contains a h1 tag, an input text filed to enter the task to be completed by the user and a button to add the tasks.

Once on clicking the button the each tasks written in the input text field is converted as an element of list items.

There is button labeled as Done which once clicked will remove the corresponding elemnent from the DOM.

This is how the project works, through this i have explored the operations of DOM...
